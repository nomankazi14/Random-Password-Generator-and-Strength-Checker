# Random-Password-Generator-and-Strength-Checker
This Python code generates a random password with a specified length and checks its strength. It ensures the password has at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one punctuation character. The code then validates the password's strength and outputs whether it is strong or weak.
